# Important Notice

LINK digital tokens (hereinafter referred to as “LINK”) are not intended to constitute securities, units in a collective investment scheme, or other capital market products each as defined under the Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289) (“SFA”) of Singapore, or its equivalent or any other regulated products in any jurisdiction.

LINK does not entitle you to any ownership or any other interest in Naver Corporation, LINE Corporation, LINE TECH PLUS PTE. LTD. (“LTP”) and/or any of their affiliated companies (together, “LINE”).

LTP is not required to be licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as LINK does not constitute a regulated product, emoney or “digital payment token” in Singapore. LTP does not provide any digital payment token services in Singapore. Please note that Singapore residents and entities are specifically excluded from participating in LTP’s initiatives.

Please note that you may not be able to recover any monies paid for LINK in the event that the LINE Token Economy fails to materialize or where LTP’s business fails.

This Whitepaper is meant to provide more information on the LINE Token Economy and functions of LINK, and does not constitute a prospectus or offer document of any sort.

This Whitepaper does not constitute or form part of any opinion or any advice to sell, or any recommendation or solicitation of any offer to purchase LINK nor shall it or any part of it or the fact of its presentation form the basis of, or be relied upon in connection with, any contract or investment decision.

No person is bound to enter into any contract or binding legal commitment in relation to the sale and purchase of LINK and no digital tokens or other form of payment is to be accepted on the basis of this Whitepaper.

Any agreement between LTP and you as a recipient or purchaser, and in relation to any airdrop, sale or purchase of LINK is to be governed by a separate document setting out the terms and conditions (the “T\&Cs”) of such agreement. In the event of any inconsistencies between the T\&Cs and this Whitepaper, the T\&Cs shall prevail. Your eligibility to receive, purchase or sell LINK on digital token exchanges, including the BITFRONT and BITMAX exchange, is subject to your compliance with their respective terms and conditions.

No regulatory authority has examined or approved any of the information set out in this Whitepaper. No such action has been or will be taken under the laws, regulatory requirements or rules of any jurisdiction. The publication, distribution or dissemination of this Whitepaper does not imply that the applicable laws, regulatory requirements or rules have been complied with.

Restrictions on distribution and dissemination

The distribution or dissemination of this Whitepaper or any part thereof may be prohibited or restricted by the laws, regulatory requirements and rules of any jurisdiction. In the case where any restriction applies, you are to inform yourself about, and to observe, any restrictions which are applicable to your possession of this Whitepaper or such part thereof (as the case may be) at your own expense and without liability to LINE. Persons who have been provided access to this Whitepaper or to whom a copy of this Whitepaper has been distributed or disseminated or who otherwise have the Whitepaper in their possession shall not circulate it to any other persons, reproduce or otherwise distribute this Whitepaper or any information contained herein for any purpose whatsoever nor permit or cause the same to occur.

Risks and uncertainties

Prospective purchasers of LINK should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and uncertainties associated with LINE, and its businesses and operations, and all information set out in this Whitepaper and the T\&Cs, prior to any purchase of LINK.

You should not transact in LINK if you are not familiar with virtual currencies of this nature. Transacting in virtual currencies may not be suitable for you if you are not familiar with the technology in which LINK services will be provided.

You should be aware that the value of LINK may fluctuate greatly. You should buy LINK only if you are prepared to accept the risk of losing all the money you put into LINK.

As previously indicated, participating dApps will receive allocations of LINK from LTP that are to be distributed to dApp users. Subject to dApp’s respective distribution policies, dApps may from time to time, either directly or indirectly, make large distributions of LINK to users, which could have the effect of increasing the overall supply of LINK that is traded on relevant trading platforms. It is possible that such distributions could have a negative impact on the market price of LINK, particularly if a large number of recipients of LINK engage in sales of LINK on relevant trading platforms in a short period of time. Please note that a specific way of each dApp’s distributions of LN may vary depending upon each dApp’s jurisdiction or country of registration to fully comply with applicable regulations.

LINK Issuance Costs

LINE will, in any event, incur no costs in regard to any issuance or distribution of LINK.

**THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE FUNCTIONALITIES OF LINK, OR THAT THE LINE TOKEN ECONOMY INFRASTRUCTURE, WILL BE DELIVERED OR REALISED. IF ANY OF SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO ACTUAL EVENTS, THE BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS OF LTP COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN SUCH CASES, YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF THE VALUE OF LINK. IN THE EVENT THAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED LINK, YOUR PURCHASE CANNOT BE REFUNDED OR EXCHANGED.**

**IF YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT AS TO THE ACTION YOU SHOULD TAKE, YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR LEGAL, FINANCIAL, TAX OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISOR(S).**
