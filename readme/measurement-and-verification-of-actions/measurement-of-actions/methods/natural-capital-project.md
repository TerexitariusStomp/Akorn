Tools The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs ([InVEST](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/software/invest)) toolset from Stanford's Natural Capital Project is an open source suite of tools that is capable of measuring the benefits (both in units and monetarily) to air, water, soil etc. from regenerative activities. This toolset will serve as a base toolset from which we analyze activities. These tools are also capable of relating the outputs to how they help to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
