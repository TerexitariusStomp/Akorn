[dClimate](https://www.dclimate.net) has substantial experience uploading satellite data into decentralized storage solutions for use in web3 applications. We plan to utilize their knowledge to first upload the interpreted satellite imagery data (for measurement and verification of actions as well as benefits from these actions) and then upload the open source base data (such as Landsat imagery that we will first source from Astraea).
