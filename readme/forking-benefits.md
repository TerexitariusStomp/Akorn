# Forking Benefits

## Forking the Marketplace

The intention for allowing people to be able to fork the marketplace is so that they are able to help in the recruitment efforts of artists and other regenerative projects. It is thought that some of the NFTs in their marketplace will continue to be minted with our technology. When NFTs are minted with our technology and regenerative project partners in their marketplace, their contracts are engrained with code that allows for unbroken royalty transfer across marketplaces and chains. This means that Akorn DAO, the artists and the regenerative projects will continue to receive royalties from them.&#x20;

## Forking the Methods

People can fork the methods we have developed and use them in their own marketplace. However in order to have the methods work (i.e. the satellite imagery be analyzed) an entity needs to be paid (Astraea in the case of satellite imagery), when this entity is paid a percentage of the pay is channeled to Akorn DAO. Forking of methods allows the entities that had a role in creating them continue to benefit by having them used, but also the ability for other entities to improve upon them.&#x20;

## Forking the DAO tools&#x20;

In order to create Akorn DAO we needed to implement a large number of tools (Discord server and the tools in them as a point (SourceCred, bots, etc.)). Other people will want to set up their own communities. We will have written instructions on how to fork the tools we use to support other DAOs. If the entity setting up the DAO needs more help beyond that, they are able to submit a request for help. If the DAO decides that it is worth their time to help with setup then they will agree to help setup the DAO. By allowing the forking and assisting the entity in the forking, there will be more DAOs we can interact with and that might aid Akorn DAO in their work.  &#x20;
