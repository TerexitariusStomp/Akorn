# Knowledge Mapping

We use Sobol to map the knowledge bases of our DAO members and what groups they are working in. Can take a look at our map [here.](https://sobol.io/d/akorn\_dao/structure)

One of the ways in which we show who the DAO members are within Sobol are by having them fill out[ personality tests](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EADEAfITaeUPaWXFA-r3lhMlp6cpsYkPD32Jb4pQyDs/edit?usp=sharing) and tell us what their results were, along with that we encourage members to doxx themselves by showing their LinkedIn on Sobol.

Another tool we are looking at potentially implementing is [Sociomapping](https://www.sociomapping.com).&#x20;
