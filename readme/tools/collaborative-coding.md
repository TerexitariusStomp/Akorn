# Collaborative Coding

## Github

We use Github to keep our code open source and editable by the community. Akorn's repository can be found [here](https://github.com/TerexitariusStomp/Akorn).

## Zenhub

For organizational members that regularly contribute code to Akorn, they become part of the Akorn team and we keep track of each other [here. ](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/akornteam-61d398f6dcb164001532887a/board?invite=true)

## Radicle

Eventually we would like to transfer away from a centralized Github repository and try other tools. [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz) is on this list.&#x20;
