# Certifications

Certifications from both the implementing organization and the artists whose work is engrained in the NFT provide value. We want these certifications to be recognized and detailed in the NFT metadata. For example an implementing organization that is certified with the sustainable forestry alliance might have a different value NFT than one that is not. Similarly an artist that has been certified with an artistic practice (such as [Oika](https://oika.com)) might be valued differently than one that is not. &#x20;
