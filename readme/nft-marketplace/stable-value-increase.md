# Stable Value Increase

Traditional NFT minting is backed partially by a cryptocurrency (I.e. ethereum) which is volatile. Our NFT minting is backed by regenerative actions the environmental benefits from which accrue over time. Along with that each time an NFT is minted a staked Akorn DAO token is embedded into the artwork. This token is representative of the value of Akorn and as long as it stakes, accumulates this value. Its irreversibly fused into the artworks smart contract. As long as AkornDAO exists it represents an economic interest and stake in the DAO.&#x20;
