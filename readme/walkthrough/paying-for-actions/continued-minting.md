# Continued Minting

Once the entities regenerative action that they had crowdfunded has been measured and verified to have occured, we create a site on our page that allows for our community to select where they would like to pay for an action to occur, how many of those actions they'd like to pay for and personalize their NFT to their liking. Each time an NFT is bought it funds at least twice the amount of the regenerative action allowing us to continue to have a supply ready. We fund for these actions to occur until the amount that the entity has specified they are able to support in the entity information. For this example 200 acres total. Each time that the project location or action changes drastically we ask the entity to carry out another crowdfunding campaign.&#x20;
