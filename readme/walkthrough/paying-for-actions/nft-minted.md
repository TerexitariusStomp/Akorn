# NFT Minted

Once the amount of crowdfunding needed for the regenerative action is reached, 100% of that funding is sent to the organization to do the regenerative action. An NFT is minted for each funder based upon the funding amount needed in relation to the amount provided from the founder. In this case the funder donated one dollar (USD $1) which allowed them to fund the protection of .01 acres of land. The benefits from the .01 acres of land are analyzed and dynamically updated through various methods. At any point in time, even if the action has yet to be measured and verified to have taken place, the NFT can be traded (sold or bought). If wanted the NFT below could be traded for 10 carbon ton tokens, 5 gallon water tokens or 20 nitrogen tokens as each of these benefits have been measured and verified to have occured.&#x20;
