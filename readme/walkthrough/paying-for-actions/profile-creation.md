# Profile Creation

From the information collected, a profile is created. The organization can either choose their own art for the NFT or select from artists we pay to produce art for the NFTs in the crowdfunding campaigns. Based upon the NFT they select a different color circle will appear showing the license (in this case yellow circle: creative commons). When donors want to fund the action they click the fund button and pay in either fiat or crypto. Whenever we crowdfund we crowdfund for at least twice the action cost (in this case USD $322) and only embed one of those actions within the NFT, this allows us to have a supply of actions ready for after the crowdfunded organization has been verified.
