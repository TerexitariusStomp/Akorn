# Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs

The first methodologies we want to start with are from the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs tools ([the InVEST toolset](http://releases.naturalcapitalproject.org/invest-userguide/latest/index.html#)). This toolset is developed by Stanford and has wide recognition in the scientific community. In particular the [Mapping Ecosystem Services for Human Wellbeing ](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/publications/mesh-factsheet-mapping-ecosystem-services-human-wellbeing)(MESH) toolset will act as a guide for selecting data that can be interoperable with different ecosystem service valuation models. The current data needs are for the nutrient retention, water yield, crop production, carbon storage, pollination, GLOBIO and sediment delivery models. &#x20;
