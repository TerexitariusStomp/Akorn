# Administrative Boundaries

The administrative boundaries layer that MESH pulls from is from [Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/?s=administrative+boundaries). [Open Street Maps](https://planet.openstreetmap.org) may be another good source for this data.  Shamba does not have this data available.
