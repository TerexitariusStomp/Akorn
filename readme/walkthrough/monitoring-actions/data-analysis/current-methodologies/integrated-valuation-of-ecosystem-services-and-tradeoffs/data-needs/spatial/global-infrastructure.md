# Global Infrastructure

The data source that MESH pulls from for infrastructure, canals, highways, roads, transmission lines is not defined. However a good potential source for this is [Open Street Maps](https://planet.openstreetmap.org).  Shamba does not have this data available but could[ bring it onboard](https://explorer.earthengine.google.com/#search/infrastructure).&#x20;
