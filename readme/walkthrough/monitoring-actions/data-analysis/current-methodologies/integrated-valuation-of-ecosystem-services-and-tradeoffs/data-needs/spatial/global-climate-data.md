# Global Climate Data

The climate data the MESH Pulls from is [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org). [dClimate](https://www.dclimate.net) might be another good data source.  Shamba does not have this data available but could[ bring it in](https://explorer.earthengine.google.com/#search/climate). Astraea has data that could be good for this but does not have an oracle.&#x20;
