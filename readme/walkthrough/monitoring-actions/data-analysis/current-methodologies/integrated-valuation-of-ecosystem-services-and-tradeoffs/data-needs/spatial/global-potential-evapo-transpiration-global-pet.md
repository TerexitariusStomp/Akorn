# Global Potential Evapo-Transpiration (Global-PET)

The current data that the MESH toolset pools from is [CGIAR-CSI](https://cgiarcsi.community/data/global-aridity-and-pet-database/). Shamba has an alternative to this [dataset available](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS\_006\_MOD16A2) and could [bring others in](https://explorer.earthengine.google.com/#search/evapotranspiration).&#x20;
