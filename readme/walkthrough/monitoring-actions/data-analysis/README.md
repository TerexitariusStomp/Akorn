# Data Analysis

The first and most important piece of data is the location of the regenerative action. This can either be in point or polygon form depending on the action (for example a tree being planted would be point form, while a forest being maintained would be polygon). If it is in point form a buffer of two feet around the tree is done, to create a polygon.&#x20;

From our data union the data needed to measure and verify that the regenerative activity has been done is sourced. From there the base data from Restor.eco is captured and data from the data union is sourced again for analyzing benefits from the regenerative action.&#x20;

We use open source methodologies for analyzing the data as well as measuring and verifying the benefits from the regenerative action.&#x20;
