# Astraea

We have established connections with Astraea. Astraea has yet to develop a Web3 oracle. When we are in need of their data repository (including potentially fine scale imagery data from Maxar) we will connect with them and see how we can get their data to the Web3 world (potentially through Shamba).&#x20;
