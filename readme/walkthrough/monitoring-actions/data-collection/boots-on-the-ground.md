# Boots on the Ground

## Georeferenced Imagery

When something is too small to see from satellite imagery. Due to this we need to use boots on the ground to collect georeferenced imagery. This imagery can be collected from any smartphone, newer smartphones have the ability to take LiDAR data as well. From this data we use ML algorithms to detect if there is a tree in the image, what kind of tree it is (powered by [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org)), and how much of a tree there is (the quantity of mass: LiDAR gives us better data for this). Protocol Gemini is currently developing this system. We would also work with them to create an app that traces the perimeter of an action area by having the implementing entity walk the perimeter.&#x20;
