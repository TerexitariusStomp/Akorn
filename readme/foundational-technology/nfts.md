# NFTs

We believe in being chain agnostic (Polygon, Ethereum, Wax, Flow etc.) and will be using a layer that is able to be bridged to all of these chains so that our NFTs can be traded on them and the marketplaces that exist on each. This layer is going public in March but allows us to have 2.4 quadrillion NFTs (ready to be minted into Akorn NFTs) that we can load data into for a fraction of the cost that any other chain would allow.
