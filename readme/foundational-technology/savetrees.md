# SaveTrees

Perpetual funding for regenerative actions by market trading. SaveTrees is a fork of Safemoon, with every transaction there is a 10% tax. 5% of this tax goes towards liquidity and 5% goes to reward holders. To perpetually fund regenerative actions with tree planting what SaveTrees has done is to create holding pools dedicated towards tree planting. The holding pool uses the 5% reward that goes to holders of SaveTrees to accumulate resources for tree planting. The holding pool has a specified token value. Each time the pool accumulates resources beyond that value, it uses the excess resources to pay for tree planting. In the Akorn Marketplace regenerative actions are grouped by biome sector, SaveTrees would fall under the forest biome. Now instead of using these resources to fund just tree planting. These resources can be channeled towards any regenerative action in that sector. As each sector develops (ocean, desert, tundra, etc.), new funding pools would be put into the marketplace. For the Akorn Marketplace, each time a person pays for an action in a sector to be done, a percentage fee is placed. A percentage of this fee is used to buy that SaveTrees and either burn or accumulate it in a holding pool, based on DAO decision. This allows for people when paying for an action to be implemented, accumulate additional resources for that action. This is used for the quadratic funding pool.
