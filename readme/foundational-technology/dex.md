# DEX

Although currently we are only able to accept a select set of tokens as determined by Nuvei. We are working with them so that we can tap into the liquidity of decentralized exchanges, allowing us to be able to accept any coin on the chain the DEX is on as payment for minting the NFTs. When this integration is done we will invest in the DEX partner tokens.
