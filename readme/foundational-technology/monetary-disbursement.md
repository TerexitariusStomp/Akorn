# Monetary Disbursement

Most organizations that carry out regenerative actions do not accept cryptocurrency. Without the ability to accept cryptocurrency for actions like tree planting, cryptocurrency organizations are unable to offset their environmental impact. It also blocks people in countries that transact in different fiat currencies than the one accepted by the regenerative organization to readily pay the organizations for their actions. By enabling cryptocurrency purchases for different organizations, we can be the bridge for them to the world of cryptocurrency. When actions with partner regenerative organizations are paid for in fiat currencies, there is the possibility of the people that pay for regenerative actions to use this moment as a bridge to the world of cryptocurrency. We will facilitate this experience for them. However, any donation via fiat directly that does not have a Metamask linked will not have the NFT sent to them (as they do not have a wallet) instead the NFT goes to the DAO the fiat goes straight to the entity and is not able to be returned. We will use Nuvei for the fiat-crypto payment rails and ensure that the organizations we work with are paid in fiat unless they choose otherwise. Along with that we will work with [Nuvei](https://nuvei.com) to ensure that mobile banking accounts are able to receive payments as we realize this is an alternative to traditional banking that is readily chosen in developing countries.&#x20;
