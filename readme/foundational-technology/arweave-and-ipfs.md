# Arweave and IPFS

We will use a combination of Arweave and IPFS to store data related to Akorn permanently in an immutable manner. This is especially relevant to the art in NFTs as well as the measurement and verification of regenerative activities and the benefits from them. A premade storage solution that we can integrate is [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage).&#x20;
