# Vote Weighting

We use several mechanisms for vote weighting

time weighted voting power

For voting votes are weighted by the number of tokens the voter holds multiplied by the time that the holder has locked them. This helps to create a recurring value into long-term thinking.

Quadratic Voting&#x20;

In order for people to really support the proposals they like, we are considering the implementation of quadratic voting. Can learn more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic\_voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic\_voting)

Reputation Voting

In the future we may use Colony's reputation voting system. &#x20;
