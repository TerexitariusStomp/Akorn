# DAO

DAO Diversity is being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance. Belonging is being able to pick the music. Verna Myers&#x20;

DAO onboarding will teach new contributors how to hard-fork the DAO itself.

most DAOs don't need more people, so the best use of their resources is creating their own spin-off version of the DAO.

this promotes healthy biodiversity while DAOs expand by staying small.
