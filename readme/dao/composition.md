# Composition

The people that make the DAO community are composed of experts in measurement and verification of regenerative actions, entities that are implementing regenerative activities (after they have had their first regenerative action measured and verified to be implemented), artists, and the lay community. For the initial composition of this community please review token distribution. This community composition will change over time as DAO tokens are traded.
