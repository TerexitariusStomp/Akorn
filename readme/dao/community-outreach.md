In Real Life- Physical

Merchandise

As with any organization one of the ways to get people to know your brand is to have people wear your stuff. We will create sustainable fashion that can be worn in real life but that is sold as NFTs [https://www.auroboros.co.uk/](https://www.auroboros.co.uk) [https://www.bosonprotocol.io/](https://www.bosonprotocol.io)

Art Studios

We will partner with studios to host our NFT artwork, such as IRL art. There is also the possibility for us to establish our own in real life NFT studio.&#x20;

Billboards

Crypto has been taking over billboards lately and we can definitely see this marketing opportunity. When available we will use billboards to let people know about Akorn. &#x20;
