# Onboarding

When new members are on boarded into our primary communication channel (for now Discord (put invite link here) for Akorn DAO they are welcomed by a community ruleset as well as our mission, vision and values. They are free to communicate with members of the DAO within the communication channels and participate in our voice chats.&#x20;

Differentiation from DAO members

The main thing that differentiates new members from someone in the DAO is holding the DAO token.&#x20;

Forking DAO

These members are also shown how to fork the components we are using in the DAO to create a new DAO, we have a channel setup just for this. By showing members how to fork Akorn DAO components, the idea would be that they are able to set up specialized communities that would work with Akorn DAO and report back what they find working with their community. This will help to set up small specialized groups of people working together. For a list of other DAOs we work with click [here](https://sobol.io/d/akorn\_dao).
