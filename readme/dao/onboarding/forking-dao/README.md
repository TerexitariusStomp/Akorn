# Forking DAO

All Discord channel members are also shown how to fork the components we are using in the DAO to create a new DAO, we have a channel setup just for this. By showing members how to fork Akorn DAO components, the idea would be that they are able to set up specialized communities that would work with Akorn DAO and report back what they find working with their community. This will help to set up small specialized groups of people working together. For a list of other DAOs we work with click [here](https://sobol.io/d/akorn\_dao).
