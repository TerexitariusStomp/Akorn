# Proof of Existence

In order for newly onboarded DAO members to recieve rewards they must verify their proof of existence/ proof of humanity. The current way in which we  use this is by using Governor DAO's proof of existence portal. Our current POE portal is biased against people whose first language is not English and people who are mute, we are trying to find solutions around that and are very willing to hear any suggestions.
