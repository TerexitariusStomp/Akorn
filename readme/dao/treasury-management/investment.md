# Investment

A percentage of the revenue garnered by Akorn will be channeled towards investments. Initially this is 10% (up for debate). We prioritize our investments towards the partners we work with in the regenerative finance movement, tokens of other DAOs we work with, as well as our own tokens and NFTs. All tokens and NFTs we invest in as part of AkornDAO are owned by the decentralized treasury, allowing us to buy and sell the tokens as the DAO sees fit.
