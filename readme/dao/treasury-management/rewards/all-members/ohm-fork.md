# Ohm Fork

All token holders are encouraged to stake their DAO token, not only to increase their voting power but also to receive rewards for being a DAO member. We are currently in the process of creating a proposal to utilize staked Klima DAO tokens as the base of our Ohm Fork that we will send to the Klima community to get their input on (feel free to contribute [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zrqvuXdEpAR28LBGR8zVSUcCAP6rKp6ZZ2ENH\_TO2n4/edit?usp=sharing)). By utilizing the existing Klima token as the fork instead of USDC or another existing cryptocurrency we are able to tap into their APY to reward our DAO members as their treasury evolves. For bonding curves within our own Ohm Fork we will focus primarily on tokens we create but will also consider adding other regenerative finance cryptocurrencies as they are deemed suitable investments by the DAO.

Also will research [creating bonds with Olympus](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro/olympus-pro-partners/getting-started).&#x20;
