# Invoices

For contributions that are not adequately rewarded by our existing reward benefits, core members and the DAOs we work with can invoice us. If the invoice amount is acceptable for the work being rewarded (as determined by the core members) we agree to and pay the invoice. We use smart invoices to record this transaction: [https://smartinvoice.xyz/](https://smartinvoice.xyz)&#x20;
