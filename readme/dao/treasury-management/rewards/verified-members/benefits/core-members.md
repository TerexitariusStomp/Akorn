# Core Members

As the DAO evolves core members will come and go. Verified members will feel their presence and have that presence be measured through Coordinape and SourceCred. When an individual becomes a core member it will be documented in our Sobol map. These core members are able to receive benefits beyond standard contributors.&#x20;
