# Benefits

SourceCred, Coordinape, and Invite Link metrics (other tools will be incorporated as found suitable) are used to measure contributions to the DAO community. Based upon those contributions benefits will be distributed.&#x20;

## Invite Link

An important role for community building is to get more community members on board. We will measure members ability to onboard members to our social channels and reward them based upon how they have done each month. The benefit pool is renewed each month, this pool is a sub account of our treasury that can be viewed here (add link).&#x20;

## SourceCred

SourceCred is implemented in both our Github and Discord. This allows the community to vote on how important members contributions have been through interacting with records of it. Benefits are then awarded to you based upon your contributions, higher importance score the larger percent of the benefit pool you are awarded. To learn more about SourceCred click [here](https://sourcecred.io). The benefit pool is renewed each month and is different from the Invite Link pool, this pool is a sub account of our treasury that can be viewed here (add link).&#x20;

## Coordinape

Different knowledge communities will know better about how valuable their members contributions have been. Based upon our Sobol map we will create circles. These circles receive tokens they can then gift to other members to show them how important their efforts have been within that knowledge community. Each month these tokens are then able to be redeemed for a percentage of the benefit pool. To learn more click [here](https://docs.coordinape.com). This pool is different from the SourceCred pool and can be viewed here (add link).
