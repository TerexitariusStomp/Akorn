# Community Groups

In our Discord we have several broad community groups that anyone can tap into, even if they do not have a DAO token. These are book club, support group, and video game gang.&#x20;

## Book Club

To engage interest in web 3 and sustainability we have a reading list that we are reading as a collective. Regular book readings are held in our Discord as well as community conversations about the readings.&#x20;

## Support Group

Whatever you are going through we want to help you to find resources to help and be there for you. This group is for supporting our members in whatever way we can.&#x20;

## Video Game Gange

Is the place for all gamers that are part of Akorn to share with us what they have been/ are gaming.
