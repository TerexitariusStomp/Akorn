# Treasury Management

Our treasury is kept in a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io). We plan to use [Llama](https://llama.xyz) to transparently show actions associated with the Gnosis Safe and help to manage our treasury. When doing transactions we are planning on using snapshot with Reality.Eth. Another tool we are looking into for collaborative budgeting is [Cobudget](https://cobudget.co/#/#pricing). Other tools will be listed as they are incorporated (One on our list is https://coinshift.xyz/)&#x20;
