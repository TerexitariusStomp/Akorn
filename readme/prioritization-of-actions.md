# Prioritization of Actions

Prioritization of actions will be heavily informed by the latest scientific reports and studies. Examples of tools/ studies we will use are from the Natural Capital Project and the [Global Safety Net](https://www.globalsafetynet.app/viewer/). An example scientific report is [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00803-6-). Akorn will also work on creating it's own tools and work with the DAO in the creation of them. We will prioritize areas that create equity in gender, racial, ethnic. etc.
