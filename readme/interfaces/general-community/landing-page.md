# Landing Page

The landing page is the primary market for new crowdfunding campaigns on our platform. Each new campaign is shown with an art piece/ pieces able to be received from the campaign, the amount of action that the campaign supports and the total amount of funding needed to be reached.&#x20;

On the landing page a cookies and or trackers notification will be displayed as well as terms of use contract. This notification needs to be accepted or modified before the community member is allowed to proceed further. This allows us to create dynamic algorithms to curate content to community members based upon their location and other characteristics. &#x20;
