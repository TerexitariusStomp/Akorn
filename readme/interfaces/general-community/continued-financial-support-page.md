# Continued Financial Support Page

Once the organization has had their first crowdfunded action measured and verified to be completed, they are able to have a section on the continued financial support page. This page allows anyone to select the amount of action they want to support, what specific project they would like to support, and either mint their NFT or lazy mint the NFT with a message, video, music, etc. (personalizing the NFT as they would like).&#x20;
