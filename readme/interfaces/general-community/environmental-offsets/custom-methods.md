# Custom Methods

## Traditional Economic Data

We will use tax information to calculate environmental impact from all sorts of different entities (like [TurboTax](https://turbotax.intuit.com)).&#x20;

## Crypto Data

We will work with cryptocurrency mining companies (especially operating systems for cryptocurrency miners (like [RaveOS](https://raveos.com)) and mining pools) to offer our tokens for miners to offset their environmental impact and create algorithms for them that calculate the amount of environmental impact being offset. We will also work to create calculators for cryptocurrency transaction histories (wallet integrations) and the amount of environmental impact needing to be offset there (this will also likely be a partnership with cryptocurrency tax calculation companies like [ZenLedger](https://www.zenledger.io)). &#x20;
