# Funders Rewards (NFTS)

Once the crowdfunding amount is reached, 100% of that funding gets channeled to the entity to enact the regenerative activity. NFTs are distributed proportionally as receipts of the funding. For example if it costs an entity 100 dollars to plant 100 trees and a funder donates 1 dollar, they would receive an NFT with a record of 1 tree promised to be planted in it. This NFT will be dynamically updated over time as the regenerative action is confirmed to have taken place and the benefits from it are measured and verified.&#x20;
