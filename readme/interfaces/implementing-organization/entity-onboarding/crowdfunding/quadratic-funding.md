# Quadratic Funding

A part of the percentage fees from trading on the marketplace goes to a quadratic funding matching pool for different regenerative actions. The actions, types, etc. to incentivize are decided by the DAO. As donations to the crowdfunding campaign occur the quadratic funding pool is utilized to encourage funding of actions that funders support. The funding channeled to the action from the quadratic funding pool is given the same rewards, NFT receipt, as the funders receive. This NFT is managed by the DAO and is able to be transferred (sold) through their decisions.&#x20;
