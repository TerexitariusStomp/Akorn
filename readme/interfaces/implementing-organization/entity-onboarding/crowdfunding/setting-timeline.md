# Setting Timeline

With the crowdfunding page created the entity can choose the timeline from which they expect to achieve the funding needed (months, days, year). This timeline sets a deadline by which the crowdfunding amount needs to be reached, if it is not reached by that date the funding is sent back to each funder (fiat is not sent back to the funder accounts that have not connected a crypto wallet, funders are made aware of this. Any funding that was received this way gets sent as a donation to Akorn DAO treasury).
