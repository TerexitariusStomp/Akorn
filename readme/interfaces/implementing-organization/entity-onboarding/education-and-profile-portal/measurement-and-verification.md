# Measurement and Verification

When an entity proposes a regenerative action to take place they also propose how they will measure and verify that the action happened. Data collection can be done through satellite imagery, smart technology, or boots on the ground. We will have a data collection and analysis knowledge repository that different regenerative actions can tap into so they don't have to create new methods. If our repository doesn't have methods that are able to be used with the regenerative action the organization can contact us and we will help them to develop something new. This repository will be constantly updated to keep up with the most scientific process for the measurement and verification of actions as well as the additional benefits from them.&#x20;
