# Maintenance Support

When the entity proposed the regenerative action to take place, they specified a maintenance fee to them per year for as long as the action is creating benefits. From Akorn DAOs  revenue sources, we will try our best to pay the maintenance fee. If the maintenance fee is deemed excessive by the DAO community, then the entity and DAO will negotiate until a reasonable fee is set.&#x20;
