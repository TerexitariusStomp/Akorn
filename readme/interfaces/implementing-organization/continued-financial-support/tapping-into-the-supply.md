# Tapping into the Supply

Whenever we fund for a regenerative activity to take place we fund for at least two times the activity cost. We then only embed one of those activities within the NFT receipt. This allows us to have a supply available when customers want to continue financing for the regenerative activity to take place. This is for both the onboarding crowdfunding and the continued financial support stage. After the entity has been onboarded they have a section in the website for continued financial support. This section allows anyone at any point to come to the marketplace and choose where they would like to pay for an action to occur (or have their cost embedded in the NFT), how many times, and customize their NFT to their liking. The NFT can be customized with music, video, images, and messaging.&#x20;
