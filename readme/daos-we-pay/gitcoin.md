# Gitcoin

Gitcoin is an open source software collective that is the epicenter for many crypto companies to give grants to and hack with. We will continue to [get grant funding](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4006/incentivizing-actions-that-increasing-and-maintai) from Gitcoin and hire their people to help code Akorn. This includes utilizing tools for DAO management from the [Moonshot Collective](https://moonshotcollective.space) as they are created.&#x20;
