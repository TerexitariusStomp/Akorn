# LexDAO

For legal contracts and issues around law Akorn DAO taps the knowledge base of [LexDAO](https://www.lexdao.coop). LexDAO helps to create ideas of legal contracts and how to handle issues, then refers us to the proper legal team that is able to handle the particular topic. Once contracts are made [OpenLaw](https://www.openlaw.io) is used so that the contracts are recorded and open for the world to see. In the future [PolicyKit](https://policykit.org) might also be used.&#x20;
