# Metaverses

We want our NFTs to be interoperable and shown between not only marketplaces but metaverses. Metaverses we are currently considering minting NFTs in are [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org) and [Everdome](https://everdome.io). We are very open to hearing about other metaverses. Along with that we encourage people to socialize with each other in [Second Life](https://secondlife.com), usernames are displayed in [the Sobol](https://sobol.io/d/akorn\_dao/) for those that have Second Life.
