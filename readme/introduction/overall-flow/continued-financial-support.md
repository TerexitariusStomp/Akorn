# Continued Financial Support

Once the regenerative activity has been measured and verified utilizing data and methodologies approved by Akorn, the entity can receive continued financial support from the marketplace. The entity is sent a DAO token which appreciates over time based upon the DAO structure and the action they carry out is put in a different part of the website. Whenever we fund for a regenerative activity to take place we fund for at least two times the activity cost. We then only embed one of those activities within the NFT. This allows us to have a supply available when customers want to continue financing for the regenerative activity to take place. This is for both the onboarding crowdfunding and the continued financial support stage. After the entity has been onboarded they have a section in the website for continued financial support. This section allows anyone at any point to come to the marketplace and choose where they would like to pay for an action to occur, how many times, and customize their NFT to their liking. The NFT can be customized with music, video, images, and messaging. Once an IDO is complete and the initial NFT is sent. This organization is able to create more NFTs each time an action(s) is paid to be carried out. This payment can either be in cryptocurrency (our marketplace) or fiat currency.
