# Revenue Sources

Transaction Fee

Akorn DAOs primary revenue source will be a percentage fee placed on the trading of NFTs. Well known marketplaces (Rarible, Opensea) charge a 2.5% fee, our marketplace will charge a 1% fee. This fee may be eliminated altogether if other revenue sources prove viable and the DAO deems it appropriate.&#x20;

Marketing

Another revenue source is the marketing featured projects. People can pay (implementing organizations of regenerative activities, artists) to have their NFT record featured in well traveled areas of Akorn's marketplace.&#x20;

&#x20;Pay Per (Look, Watch, Listen)&#x20;

Holders or artists (depending on the artistic license granted) can monetize their NFTs through Pay Per (Look, Watch or Listen). When they do a percentage fee is placed to further support Akorn DAO, the holder of the NFT and the artist.&#x20;

Pay Per Look&#x20;

A setting is able to be applied to the NFT record to blur the art of the NFT until a payment is made. After this payment is made the image becomes clear so the payer can admire its art.&#x20;

Pay Per Watch&#x20;

For NFTs that are videos, the payer pays for the video content to be unlocked.&#x20;

Pay Per Listen

For content that is audible, payers pay to hear what is embedded.&#x20;
