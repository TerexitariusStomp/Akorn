### Environmental Concern

With greater amounts of global citizens recognizing the climate risk they are facing more concern has been channeled towards ensuring that actions, businesses, and organizations they help to fund are environmental/ sustainable (the movement with environmental and social governance in corporations is a good representation of this). More companies are turning away from cryptocurrency due to its environmental impact (such as Tesla). However there is a regenerative finance movement happening within Crypto.&#x20;

### First Steps of Crypto Regenerative Finance&#x20;

One of the first big actions of this movement was the creation of the Crypto Climate Accord which had 40 supporters including the World Economic Forum and Consensys. This accord stated that the supporters would work with their current partners to have themselves as well as their partners utilize 100% renewable energy by 2050.&#x20;
