# Entity Onboarding

## Education and Profile Portal

The first step that an entity sees when becoming an implementing organization partner with Akorn is a profile creation portal and education section as to what rights are associated with the funding they receive. We ensure that entities know that only the right to benefits, that have a monetary value and can be resold, from the regenerative actions are associated with the funding. Land rights and other rights that they have claim to will not be touched. From there it is a super simple onboarding process. At no point during the initial creation or further creation of NFTs is coding by the regenerative organizations needed. This allows for the organizations to create their NFTs easily and become part of the ecosystem.

qualitative data reporting&#x20;

he entity then enacts the regenerative activity in the area they have chosen to implement it. In order for this entity to have this action measured and verified to be completed, the entity needs to propose a methodology for this measurement and verification. Akorn will have a preset set of methodologies that these entities can choose from. These methodologies will be constantly updated to keep up with the most scientific process for the measurement and verification of actions as well as the additional benefits from them.&#x20;

Information Initial Decentralized Offering (IDO) for Regenerative Organizations Upon the DAO(s) voting to add a regenerative organization, the organization carries out an IDO for the verified and measurable work they have done to date. This IDO is for an organizational work NFT.  During the IDO the organization is encouraged to market their offering to their community (emails, texts, group messages, social media). This brings further customers to our ecosystem, supporting not only the regenerative organization doing the IDO but also organizations that are already part. Organizations that are already part of the ecosystem are encouraged to comarket the IDO as the selling of this NFT affects the overall value within the ecosystem. Unique: Has a unique ID on a public ledger and can only be counted once. This identifier ties the creation event and the NFT permanently together.
