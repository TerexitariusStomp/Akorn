# ReFi Friends

We are all about collaboration and know we aren't going to be the expert in everything. What is important to us is to channel funding towards green actions. Moonjelly DAO, Rebalance Earth, Open Forest Protocol, Bloomeria and the Regen Network are examples of communities creating methodologies to measure and create environmental offsets. We want to work with them and other decentralized offset creators, to help get the actions they support paid for. For this reason we will in the future host their credit systems on our platform. This will help to sell their credits by tapping into the network of artists that support environmental/ regenerative art and funding using our platform, as well as other resources our platform can provide. We are always on the lookout for new entities in the regenerative finance space, if you know of any please let us know so we can add it to the [climatecrypto list](https://climatecrypto.xyz) and consider them for potential partnership.
