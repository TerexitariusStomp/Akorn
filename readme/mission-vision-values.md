# Mission, Vision, Values

Mission/Purpose - A statement of why the organization exists, at the most meaningful level. It is aspirational, in that it can never be fully achieved. In this way, the purpose states why the organization does the work it does, but does not define how that work is to be done.

**Mission:** To be part of a decentralized economy in which paying for green actions leads to fair, transparent, and enriching return on investment.

Vision - A clear, specific, compelling picture of what the organization will look like at a specific time in the future (one, two, or five years), including those few key metrics that define success. It defines key results achieved and yet to be accomplished, the expected impact to the clients, and it describes specific behaviors that the organization must display to be successful. A clear vision delimits potential strategies; it helps define what’s within or outside of the organization’s bounds.

**General Vision:** To enable every person in the world to receive funding for green (environmental/ sustainable) actions, create receipts of the donations to those actions (NFTs), and make those receipts worth something through channeling data into them.

**In the short term**, allow anyone with an internet connection to be part of a decentralized community that helps them to achieve financial independence and guides them on empowering others to live and act sustainably.

**In the medium-term**, we envision Akorn as one of the leading DAOs for measuring and verifying regenerative actions as well as the benefits from them. To achieve this, we will have DAO members be able to collectively manage a treasury to fulfill this mission. In doing so it should: Onboard new members to be active stakeholders in the DAO, fund projects that improve the theory, architecture, UX, and real-world adoption of items related to Akor,

**In the long-term**, Akorn DAO enables its members to collaboratively govern and own the platforms and organizations where they invest their attention and contribute to.

Values - The boundaries within which the organization will operate in pursuit of its vision. It is critical to distinguish between core values (those on which the organization will never compromise and is willing to pay a price to uphold) and aspirational values (those that the organization espouses, but has yet to live up to in day-to-day operations). To be meaningful, values must be described in clear behavioral terms..

**Individual Member Values**

3\.      Align its stakeholders through common interests.

a.      Generate a coherent social consensus, or in game theoretic terms, a “Schelling point” around which people will naturally act. Consensus can quickly become self-enforcing. The first part of this is agreeing on the mission, principles of the Akorn DAO, and also on our objectives.

3\.      Providing Lasting Solutions to Complex Problems

4\.      A Learning Mindset - We have a hunger to learn. We learn from our mistakes and our successes. We believe that there is always room to grow and improve.

5\.      Transparency: We operate transparently and build trust through radically public discourse and financial auditability.

6\.      Resource Efficiency - We are good stewards of our resources and aim to allocate these resources in ways that are both efficient and expansive.

7\.      Value Creation - We create value not only for our community but for the whole world.

8\.      To increase the value of Akorn and its Community
