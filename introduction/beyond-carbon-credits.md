# Beyond Carbon Credits

This regenerative marketplace pays for the activity to be done, itâ€™s focus is not on the additional benefits from that action such as carbon sequestration. Once an activity is paid for, a permanent digital record of this is created. This record contains information about the activity, the measurement and verification methods, and funding amount channeled towards the activity. The record can be sold as is, without the action it paid for being measured and verified. The holder of this record could also wait for the action to become measured and verified. After that, they can hold it or wait longer. If they wait longer, data on the additional benefits from this action will accumulate; such as data about the actions impact on carbon sequestration, soil health, water quality, etc. This data can increase the value of that digital record, NFT.
