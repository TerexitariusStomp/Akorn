# Entity Onboarding

Super simple onboarding process for entities Make sure not lose land Coding Requirements At no point during the initial creation or further creation of NFTs is coding by the regenerative organizations needed. This allows for the organizations to create their NFTs easily and become part of the ecosystem.The entity then enacts the regenerative activity in the area they have chosen to implement it. In order for this entity to have this action measured and verified to be completed, the entity needs to propose a methodology for this measurement and verification. Akorn will have a preset set of methodologies that these entities can choose from. These methodologies will be constantly updated to keep up with the most scientific process for the measurement and verification of actions as well as the additional benefits from them. Once the action is implemented automated technology is utilized (satellite imagery, smart sensors and or georeferenced imagery) to measure and verify that the action has been completed, along with the additional benefits from these actions (air, water, soil, social, etc.). All of this data is channeled back into the NFT record from the funding event, this provides further value appreciation over time to the original funders of this regenerative activity.
