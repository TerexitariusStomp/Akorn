# Akorn
Akorn is a regenerative marketplace for incentivizing actions that increase or maintain native ecosystems. We are currently working with hackers during this hackathon to create something environmental/ sustainability related with open-source code. We have committed $1,000 of our grant funding (https://gitcoin.co/grants/4006/incentivizing-actions-that-increasing-and-maintain) to any developers that join our team. That means you will get $1,000 in funding just for coding with us. Link to telegram: https://t.me/+awK2bree96ViM2Yx
