# Avano-White Paper

Akorn is a decentralized community (DAO) that collectively works towards tokenizing and rewarding green (environmental/ sustainable) actions.

The primary way for incentivizing these actions is through a regenerative NFT marketplace and minting protocol.  Find out [`more`](SUMMARY.md).
