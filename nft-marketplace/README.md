# NFT Marketplace

When funding occurs for an entity to do a regenerative activity, an NFT is created. This NFT is a record of the funding amount and the amount of a regenerative activity it helped to support. Before the action has been measured and verified to have been recorded this NFT can be traded in the NFT marketplace (as a receipt of transaction). However, if the NFT is held by the funder it could create further value as the action is measured and verified to have been completed along with the additional benefits from that action.
