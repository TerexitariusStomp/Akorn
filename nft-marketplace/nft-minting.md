# NFT Minting

In order to permanently mint an NFT a regenerative action needs to be paid for. This can either be done through crowdfunding or paying for an already onboarded action to be done. Artists do not have to mint an NFT to have their work shown in the NFT marketplace, however when the work sells for the first time a part of the revenue from selling the NFT goes towards supporting the regenerative action amount that the artist embeds in the NFT.
