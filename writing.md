# Writing

## Articles and Posting

We encourage our community members to write, especially implementing organizations. We suggest at least one article per quarter and a new post per week.

## Paid for Writing

We encourage the regenerative organizations that we support to write monthly articles on the work they are doing and their experience doing it. To reach as much an audience as possible, writing should be as understandable as possible. For the writing produced we recommend checking it with[ Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/plans), [The Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/desktop.html), [Lens](https://lens.dev) or [Readable](https://readable.com/pro/) before publishing.

We then facilitate them publishing their writing on platforms that pay them for the audience they attract such as Medium, Mirror, and [1729](https://1729.com). Our DAO will also write and publish to these platforms.&#x20;

## Scientific Journals

As a good percentage of our DAO community is expected to be scientists, we want to encourage them working together and sharing their experience in open access scientific journals. One of the benefits from being a member of our DAO is that we will pay for publishing costs for open access journals, as long as the DAO community (your peer reviewers) think that it is worthwhile. An example journal to publish to would be [Ledger](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/ledger). &#x20;
