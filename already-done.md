# Already Done

## Already Paid for Action&#x20;

If the regenerative action has already been paid for (in the form of a donation without any rights tied to that donation) but not tokenized, we will tokenize the action and make you the holder of that action NFT (only half of the amount of actions paid for are captured in that, the rest are used as supply for customers to be able to come and pay for more of that action to occur). This step bypasses the crowdfunding step but collects all the information necessary to support you to carry out further actions of that type, once the aforementioned action has been carried out.&#x20;

## Already Existing Ecosystems

Our objective is to increase and **maintain** native ecosystems. When an entity wants to receive funding for the protection of an already existing ecosystem, that entity states the cost to them for continuing to protect that ecosystem. We then go through all of the steps that occur when an entity wants to do a regenerative action to increase an ecosystem.&#x20;

## Already Tokenized Offsets

We will support other organizations to sell their tokenized offsets and tokens that benefit the environment. This is done in two ways, connecting artists and buyers to the tokenized offsets and layering of offsets. Our marketplace is designed to be chain agnostic, so tokenized offsets that are created on any chain are able to be part of our marketplace. This allows us to offer the tokens the ability to be minted into an NFT with artwork. Similar to any other regenerative entity, in order for the token to be further supported after it's first sell the issuer of that token needs to provide measurable and verifiable evidence that the regenerative action it supports has been carried out. For tokens that have been measured and verified to have a regenerative action supported, these tokens can then be layered with tokens created directly with Akorn DAO.&#x20;

## Already Created Marketplaces&#x20;

We want the NFTs we help to create to not only be supported by our centralized marketplace but be able to be channeled into marketplaces such as OpenSea, Rarible etc. We will work on connecting these marketplaces for further audience traction.&#x20;
