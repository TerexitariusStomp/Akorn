# Restor

Restor.eco is a global platform where regenerative projects from around the world are inputting their polygons and receiving information as to the native flora and fauna expected to be present as well as predictions for how regeneration of the land could affect carbon, water and other areas. The regenerative projects we work with would upload their polygon into the Restor platform so we are able to capture the data provided.
