# IRL Environmental Entity Onboarding

The first step that an entity completes is inputting information about themselves and where they would like to carry out the regenerative activity.

Entity Onboarding

Education and Profile Portal

The first step that an entity sees when becoming an implementing organization partner is a profile creation portal and education section as to what rights are associated with the funding they receive. We ensure that entities know that only the right to benefits, that have a monetary value and can be resold, from the regenerative actions are associated with the funding. Land rights and other rights that they have claim to will not be touched. From there it is a super simple onboarding process. At no point throughout the entirety of the interaction is coding by the regenerative organizations needed. This allows for the organizations to easily become part of the ecosystem.

Entity Information

Following is information that the entity can update to create their unique profile. We recommend writing an individual article on each of the different sections below (within reason), publishing it and then linking that to your profile.

Crowdfunding

One the entity has created their profile and added information about the first project they would like funded, a crowdfunding page is created. This page has the information that the entity provided (details in the entity information section). The key details are the total crowdfunding amount needed (cost to implement action) and the total amount of action.

Setting Timeline

With the crowdfunding page created the entity can choose the timeline from which they expect to achieve the funding needed (months, days, year). This timeline sets a deadline by which the crowdfunding amount needs to be reached, if it is not reached by that date the funding is sent back to each funder (fiat is not sent back to the funder accounts that have not connected a crypto wallet, funders are made aware of this).

Marketing of Crowdfunding Campaign

We will work to market the crowdfunding page to attract funders. It is encouraged that the community, especially the onboarding organization, also does their part in marketing the new crowdfunding page (emails, texts, group messages, social media etc.) This brings further customers to our ecosystem, supporting not only the onboarding entity but also our community.

Continued Financial Support

After the crowdfunding campaign has reached its target funding level and the entity has received their funding, they are responsible for carrying out the regenerative action. After the regenerative action has been measured and verified utilizing approved data and methodologies, the entity can receive continued financial support. This financial support is created through token staking from treasury resources and distributed to the entity on a yearly basis. We fund for these actions to occur until the amount that the entity has specified, they are able to support in the entity information. For this example, 200 acres total. Each time that the project location or action changes drastically we ask the entity to carry out another crowdfunding campaign.

Tapping into the Supply

Whenever we fund for a regenerative activity to take place, we fund for at least two times the activity cost. We then only embed one of those activities within the NFT layer. This allows us to have a supply available when customers want to continue financing for the regenerative activity to take place. This is for both the onboarding crowdfunding and the verified entity stage. After the entity has been onboarded (their action has been measured and verified to have been carried out) they have a section in the website. This section allows anyone at any point to come to the marketplace and choose where they would like to pay for an action to occur, how many times and what NFTs they would like to be layered.

Maintenance Support

When the entity proposed the regenerative action to take place, they specified a maintenance fee to them per year for as long as the action is creating benefits. From our community revenue sources, we will try our best to pay the maintenance fee. If the maintenance fee is deemed excessive by the community, then the entity and our community will negotiate until a reasonable fee is set.

Monetary Disbursement

Most organizations that carry out regenerative actions do not accept cryptocurrency. Without the ability to accept cryptocurrency for actions like tree planting, cryptocurrencies resource stream remains untapped. It also blocks people in countries that transact in different fiat currencies than the one accepted by the regenerative organization to readily pay the organizations for their actions. By enabling cryptocurrency purchases for different organizations, we can be the, bridge for them to the world of cryptocurrency. When actions with partner regenerative organizations are paid for in fiat currencies, there is the possibility of the people that pay for regenerative actions to use this moment as a bridge to the world of cryptocurrency. We will facilitate this experience for them. However, any donation via fiat directly that does not have a cryptocurrency wallet linked will not have the NFT layer created (as they do not have a wallet or NFT identified) instead the NFT layer goes to the DAO, the fiat goes straight to the entity and is not able to be returned. We will use Nuvei for the fiat-crypto payment rails and ensure that the organizations we work with are paid in fiat unless they choose otherwise. Along with that we will work with Nuvei to ensure that mobile banking accounts are able to receive payments as we realize this is an alternative to traditional banking that is readily chosen in developing countries.
