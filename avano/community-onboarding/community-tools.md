# Community Tools

Sobol

Different knowledge communities will know better about how valuable their members contributions have been. Mapping out our community and their various knowledge basis will help create streams of work. Contributors from our Sobol map will be regularly invited to join our Coordinape.

One of the ways in which we show who the DAO members are within Sobol are by having them fill out personality tests and tell us what their results were, along with that we encourage members to doxx themselves by showing their LinkedIn on Sobol.

Twitter

Discord

Github

We use Github to keep our code open source and editable by the community. Akorn's repository can be found here.

Radicle

To collaborate within our community in coding we use Radicle. Eventually we would like to transfer away from a centralized Github repository and use Radicle entirely.

Discord Bots

We use various bots on our server. You can see the bots we use and the descriptions of them on the server.

Publicizing Voting

We want the votes we carry out to be as public as possible. We list our organization on other webpages to promote transparency such as WithTally and Commonwealth.

Mind Mapping

We encourage individuals and groups to use mind maps around ideas. The tool we encourage to use for this is MindMiester or Kumu.

Website

We want our website to be recognized by not only it's HTTPs web name but also the Ethereum Naming Service and Handshake. We will partner with Fleek to ensure that our website integrates well with these technologies.
