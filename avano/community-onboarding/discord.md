# Discord

The first step for people to become community members is to join our Discord. [https://discord.gg/km9HrmfcK3](https://discord.gg/km9HrmfcK3)

From there community members will be able to view our channels

\#│🌎│other\_languages

We value diversity and want to enable people to communicate in their native language. We enabled a Discord bot to help in translation.

\#│☘│avano\_mvv

This channel shows the constitution, mission, vision, values (MVV), and community covenant.  Community members are asked to familiarize themselves with our mission, vision, and values, constitution and covenant before contributing. In order to proceed community members need to react with a :evergreen\_tree:

\#1│📓│start\_here

After adding their tree to the previous channel, the #1│📓│start\_here channel is shown. This channel has an intro video of what our community is about as well as knowledge resources that new community members need to familiarize themselves with before continuing. These resources allow community members to have some level of familiarity with web3. After resources are reviewed community members need to react with a :mushroom: to proceed. The next four steps are outlined. Head to 2│✒│introduction ➤Select your pod 3│🐋│pod\_select ➤Get onboarded in 4│💐│onboarding ➤Learn how to get involved 5│👣│get\_involved

\#2│✒│introduction

In this channel community members are able to introduce themselves. This allows us to get to know one another.

\#3│🐋│pod\_select

Once community members have introduced themselves, they select working groups that they would like to belong to, we call them pods. Each working group has a description of what that group does associated with it. Based upon the emoji that the community member interacts with they are assigned that role and given access to those working group channels.

\#4│💐│onboarding

For community members wanting to be active contributors there are three steps on this channel to get involved. First is a form that the community members can fill out to provide us further details about themselves. After that there is an invite to a community call as well as a way to schedule a one on one. During these calls individuals are able to be connected with leaders of each of the working groups.

\#5│👣│get\_involved

After community members have been onboarded core team members are notified of the new contributor and they are added to our Sobol map, [https://sobol.io/d/akorn\_dao/structure](https://sobol.io/d/akorn\_dao/structure). They are welcomed into Celesta Labs where we keep our bounty info for work needing to be done. As well as invited to the working group calls to discuss further.

\#│📝│server-descriptions

This channel has descriptions of many of the other channels not listed here as well as the bots utilized in the server.
