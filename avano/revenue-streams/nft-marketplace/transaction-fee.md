# Transaction Fee

Akorn DAOs primary revenue source will be a percentage fee placed on the trading of NFTs. Well known marketplaces (Rarible, Opensea) charge a 2.5% fee, our marketplace will charge a 1% fee. This fee may be eliminated altogether if other revenue sources prove viable and the DAO deems it appropriate.
