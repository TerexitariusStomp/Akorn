# Pay Per (Look, Watch, Listen)

Holders or artists (depending on the artistic license granted) can monetize their NFTs through Pay Per (Look, Watch or Listen). When they do a percentage fee is placed to further support Akorn DAO, the holder of the NFT and the artist.

## Pay Per Look

A setting is able to be applied to the NFT record to blur the art of the NFT until a payment is made. After this payment is made the image becomes clear so the payer can admire its art.

## Pay Per Watch

For NFTs that are videos, the payer pays for the video content to be unlocked.

## Pay Per Listen

For content that is audible, payers pay to hear what is embedded.
