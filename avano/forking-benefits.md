# Forking Benefits

Forking Our Code

The intention for allowing people to be able to fork is so that they are able to help support other regenerative projects. When forking our codebase thereâ€™s engrained tax fees for use of the code that continue to benefit our community when there are transactions from other communities.

Forking the Methods

People can fork the methods we have developed and use them in their own marketplace. However, in order to have the methods work (i.e., the satellite imagery be analyzed) an entity needs to be paid (Astraea in the case of satellite imagery), when this entity is paid a percentage of the pay is channeled to our community. Forking of methods allows the entities that had a role in creating them continue to benefit by having them used, but also the ability for other entities to improve upon them.

Forking Community Tools

In order to create our community, we needed to implement a large number of tools (Discord server and the tools in them as a point (Coordinape, bots, etc.)). Other people will want to set up their own communities. We will have written instructions on how to fork the tools we use to support other communities. If the entity setting up the community needs more help beyond that, they are able to submit a request for help. If the community decides that it is worth their time to help with setup then they will agree to help setup the community. By allowing the forking and assisting the entity in the forking, there will be more communities we can interact with and that might aid in our work.
