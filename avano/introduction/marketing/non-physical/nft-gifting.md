# NFT Gifting

Whenever a layered NFT is transferred (within a 24 hour timeframe) the new holder of that NFT receives an additional NFT. As long as the gas costs are deemed reasonable. This NFT has a slight amount (less than the gas cost needed to remove tokens) of an interest-bearing token layered on it that is buying a ReFi token. Sending this NFT to the holder makes the holder realize that the layered NFT they just bought (which was transferred to them) is part of our community, further marketing to them and getting them interested in our community.
