# Fund Use

Development

The primary funding is for development, it is expected that this funding will be distributed back to community members that are working in a decentralized nature to make our ideas into a reality. If needed outside organizations can also be hired.

Operations

The establishment of a legal entity for our community that is able to legally issue tokens and comply with regulations will need to be done. This funding is used to recoup these expenses (as the establishment will occur before the distribution of tokens) as well as the continuation of these operations.

Marketing

We will want to partner with other decentralized organizations and news outlets to get into the public's perspective. This funding will be used for that.

Legal Framework

To make sure we comply with the legal regulations applicable we will hire a legal team. This funding will be used to cover legal expenses.

Contingencies

Any unexpected costs should be covered in the contingencies budget.
