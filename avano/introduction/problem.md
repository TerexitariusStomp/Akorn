# Problem

Avano solves for two primary problems, lack of liquidity for NFTs and no return on investment when financially supporting environmental action.

Currently an NFT is only able to be traded when another person wants it. If no one wants that NFT then it is held until a time in the future when someone does, collapsing in price over time with little to no demand.&#x20;

When financially supporting environmental action, the current standard is to receive a receipt of donation. This receipt does not provide a return on the money just sent in support of the environmental action.
