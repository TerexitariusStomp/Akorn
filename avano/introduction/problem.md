# Problem

There are two primary problems, lack of liquidity for NFTs and no return on investment when financially supporting environmental action.

Charged Particles needs more creatives using their technology, the world needs more art evocative art that changes the way people think about society, the environment and the world around them, and the ReFi space needs more financial resources getting channeled into it connected to in real life environmental action. The two main technologies able to capture financial resources in web3 are tokens and NFTs.&#x20;

Currently an NFT is only able to be traded when another person wants it. If no one wants that NFT then it is held until a time in the future when someone does, collapsing in price over time with little to no demand.&#x20;

When financially supporting environmental action, the current standard is to receive a receipt of donation. This receipt does not provide a return on the money just sent in support of the environmental action.

Tokens and NFTs are valuable when there are a community that believes in them. However for many new artists creating new NFTs attracting and maintaining this community is an issue. For new  ReFi tokens backing them with data that the action already happened and the benefits from it takes significant financial resources and time to develop a system to do the monitoring, reporting and verification of that action.

The primary person behind Avano has moved to Christchurch, New Zealand. They have moved recently into the Exchange artist community.&#x20;

Here many locals and visitors are dissatisfied with the entertainment, nightlife, and creative options in Christchurch and the wider New Zealand. Feeling it lacks the creativity and diversity found in other cities. Without alternatives, the local scene is left with an unhealthy and at times unsafe binge drinking culture, repetitive entertainment, and a socially reserved reputation. Christchurch is known for “closing early”, not because people choose, but because most venues are licensed bars, meaning the night ends when the bar closes.

One of the few alternative venues is the Exchange. However, the Exchange is no longer able to host nighttime events at their current venue and are desperately in need of an alternative space.
