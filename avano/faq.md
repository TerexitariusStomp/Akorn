Already Done

Already Paid for Action

If the regenerative action has already been paid for (in the form of a donation without any rights tied to that donation) but not tokenized, we will tokenize the action and make you the holder of that action NFT (only half of the amount of actions paid for are captured in that, the rest are used as supply for customers to be able to come and pay for more of that action to occur). This step bypasses the crowdfunding step but collects all the information necessary to support you to carry out further actions of that type, once the aforementioned action has been carried out.

Already Existing Ecosystems

Our objective is to increase and maintain native ecosystems. When an entity wants to receive funding for the protection of an already existing ecosystem, that entity states the cost to them for continuing to protect that ecosystem. We then go through all of the steps that occur when an entity wants to do a regenerative action to increase an ecosystem.

Already Tokenized Offsets

We will support other organizations to sell their tokenized offsets and tokens that benefit the environment. This is done utilizing our existing platform.
