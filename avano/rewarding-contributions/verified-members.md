# Verified Members

In order to have these benefits you need to verify your existence/ humanity by the method(s) we currently utilize.

## Universal Basic Community Income

Once a community member has been verified by our current provider of Proof of Humanity/ Existence they will receive an amount (will try to have this income be consistent each month but may vary based upon how the platform revenue is doing) of universal basic income each month to their wallet. This will encourage people to care and become stakeholders of our community. When they have become committed stakeholders, they will be eligible for further rewards.

## Core Members

As the DAO evolves core members will come and go. Verified members will feel their presence and have that presence be measured through Coordinape and other methods. When an individual becomes a core member it will be documented in our Sobol map. These core members are able to receive benefits beyond standard verified contributors
