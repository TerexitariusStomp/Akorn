# In Real Life Environmental Action

[Grandmother Grove](https://app.charged.fi/go/energize/0x63174FA9680C674a5580f7d747832B2a2133Ad8f/591) is Charged Particle’s flagship ReFi NFT. This NFT is going to be embedded with yield bearing tokens where 50% of any donation goes towards yield bearing tokens 50% goes to immediate tree planting. Throughout the year the yield is sold to plant trees through [Eden Projects](https://www.edenprojects.org/partners/seed-partners). Eden is going to be registered with [Giveth](https://giveth.io) so that when these donations occur Give is sent back to the DAO. As more projects register and get verified on Giveth there is the potential for them to propose to be funded by Grandmother Grove. The DAO then decides if this a good organization to support or not, if the DAO votes yes then it is added as an organization that gets funding. If an organization is added to receive funding it may receive a different NFT to add to Grandmother Grove’s ecosystem.&#x20;
