# Community Governance

Community Governance

Diversity is being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance. Belonging is being able to pick the music. Verna Myers

Path Towards Decentralization

At first, we will not have a governance token issued, nor any tokens or NFTs. It is expected that the governance token is issued once the decentralized surveillance system is able to create tokens.

Differentiation of Community Members

The main thing that differentiates member from someone that can govern is holding our governance token.

Governance

Our current plan for voting is to use 1hive. However, we may consider voting with other tools such as Aragon, Daohaus, Colony, Alchemy, and Snapshot.

For more details about voting visit 1hive.

NFTs for Voting

In the future we may transfer governance rights to NFTs instead of tokens, to ensure that one person equals one vote.

Voting in Other DAOs

In our treasury we will likely obtain tokens from other DAOs that allow us to participate in their proposals. We will utilize the same vote weighting as we would for our proposals to see if the proposal passes or not. The results are then utilized for voting on the other DAOs proposals.

Dispute Resolution

We hire a decentralized arbitration service for important disputes that need to be resolved. https://kleros.io/ and https://celeste.1hive.org/
