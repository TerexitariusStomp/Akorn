# Perpetual Funding

The digital record containing information about regenerative actions can be traded in an NFT marketplace or the NFT itself can be traded in a marketplace for tokens. Each time the NFT (or tokens) is traded a percentage of that trade goes towards accumulating resources. These resources are then channeled back to further support the implementers of the regenerative action to implement more actions. This provides continued support for the implementers we onboard onto the marketplace.
