# Constantly Seeking Community Feedback

The entire marketplace would be run by DAOs. A global governance DAO as well as different sector DAOs (such as forest, ocean, tundra, etc.). Sector DAOs would be composed of leading scientific experts. When a implementer of a regenerative action wants to get funding to implement the action they would propose it to Akorn. This proposal would include what the action is, where it would be implemented, how the action would be measured and verified, and the cost for the implementer to implement that action. The DAO(s) would then vote to determine if that action is appropriate, if the area of implementation is a priority, if the cost is correct, and that the measurement and verification techniques adhere to community standards. As new actions are proposed, more measurement and verification techniques can be created and updated to work with community standards. By quantifying the priority areas for action implementation according to community feedback, these actions can have more equitable social impact.
